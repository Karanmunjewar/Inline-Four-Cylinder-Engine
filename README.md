# Inline-Four-Cylinder-Engine

## üìå Description
This project demonstrates the basic working of an inline four-cylinder engine. The assembly shows how main engine components are arranged and how they interact to convert reciprocating motion into rotational motion.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Software Used
- SolidWorks 2019

## üìê Features & Highlights
- [‚úî] Complete 3D model of a typical inline four-cylinder engine
- [‚úî] Demonstrates piston, connecting rod, crankshaft, and cylinder block arrangement

## üìÇ Project Structure
- `/CAD/` ‚Äî Contains SolidWorks part (`.SLDPRT`) and assembly (`.SLDASM`) files
- `/Renders/` ‚Äî Includes renders and exploded views of the assembly
- `/Docs/` ‚Äî Contains design notes or any related PDFs

## üñºÔ∏è Preview

## üìà What I Learned
- Developed skills in multi-part assemblies and proper mating in SolidWorks
- Understood the arrangement and working of basic IC engine components

## üìé How to Use / Open
> Open the `.SLDASM` file in SolidWorks 2019 or later.  
> View renders in the `/Renders/` folder for a quick look.
