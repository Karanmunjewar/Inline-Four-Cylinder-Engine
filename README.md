# Inline-Four-Cylinder-Engine

## 📌 Description
This project demonstrates the basic working of an inline four-cylinder engine. The assembly shows how main engine components are arranged and how they interact to convert reciprocating motion into rotational motion.

## ⚙️ Tools & Software Used
- SolidWorks 2019

## 📐 Features & Highlights
- [✔] Complete 3D model of a typical inline four-cylinder engine
- [✔] Demonstrates piston, connecting rod, crankshaft, and cylinder block arrangement

## 📂 Project Structure
- `/CAD/` — Contains SolidWorks part (`.SLDPRT`) and assembly (`.SLDASM`) files
- `/Renders/` — Includes renders and exploded views of the assembly
- `/Docs/` — Contains design notes or any related PDFs

## 📈 What I Learned
- Developed skills in multi-part assemblies and proper mating in SolidWorks
- Understood the arrangement and working of basic IC engine components

## 📎 How to Use / Open
> Open the `.SLDASM` file in SolidWorks 2019 or later.  
> View renders in the `/Renders/` folder for a quick look.
